## Asset Classes

The system allocates across eight asset classes, each with distinct risk-return characteristics:

| Asset Class | Risk Score | 10-Year Return | Volatility | Risk Profile |
|-------------|------------|----------------|------------|--------------|
| **Bonds** | 1.0 | 4.44% | 3.29% | LOW-RISK |
| **Market ETF** | 2.0 | 7.89% | 14.74% | BELOW AVG TOLERANCE |
| **Large Cap** | 3.0 | 7.85% | 14.32% | AVERAGE TOLERANCE |
| **US Mid Cap** | 3.2 | 9.55% | 17.68% | AVERAGE TOLERANCE |
| **US Small Cap** | 4.0 | 9.22% | 19.55% | ABOVE AVG TOLERANCE |
| **Foreign Ex** | 4.1 | 2.26% | 18.21% | ABOVE AVG TOLERANCE |
| **Emerging** | 5.0 | 5.57% | 23.60% | HIGH RISK |
| **Commodities** | 5.1 | -2.62% | 18.11% | HIGH RISK |

### Asset Class Selection Rationale
- **Bonds**: Foundation for stability and income
- **Market ETF**: Broad market exposure with lower costs
- **Large Cap**: Stable equity exposure with dividend potential
- **US Mid Cap**: Growth potential with moderate risk
- **US Small Cap**: Higher growth potential, higher volatility
- **Foreign Ex**: Geographic diversification
- **Emerging**: High growth potential, high risk
- **Commodities**: Excluded due to negative historical returns

## Rule-Based Allocation Model

### Allocation Strategy

The rule-based model uses fixed percentage allocations that align with each fund's risk tolerance:

#### Conservative Investors (60% Bonds)
```
Bonds: 60.0%
Market ETF: 25.0%
Large Cap: 15.0%
Other Assets: 0.0%
```

#### Pre-Retirees (55% Bonds)
```
Bonds: 55.0%
Market ETF: 25.0%
Large Cap: 20.0%
Other Assets: 0.0%
```

#### Balanced Investors (35% Bonds)
```
Bonds: 35.0%
Market ETF: 20.0%
Large Cap: 25.0%
US Mid Cap: 15.0%
US Small Cap: 5.0%
Other Assets: 0.0%
```

#### Second Chance Retirees (25% Bonds)
```
Bonds: 25.0%
Market ETF: 15.0%
Large Cap: 30.0%
US Mid Cap: 20.0%
US Small Cap: 5.0%
Foreign Ex: 5.0%
Other Assets: 0.0%
```

#### Aggressive Investors (10% Bonds)
```
Bonds: 10.0%
Market ETF: 10.0%
Large Cap: 25.0%
US Mid Cap: 25.0%
US Small Cap: 15.0%
Foreign Ex: 10.0%
Emerging: 5.0%
Other Assets: 0.0%
```

### Design Principles

1. **Risk Progression**: Bond allocation decreases as risk tolerance increases (60% → 10%)
2. **Equity Diversification**: Higher risk funds include more asset classes
3. **Geographic Exposure**: International exposure limited to moderate-high and high-risk funds
4. **Stability Foundation**: All funds maintain some bond exposure
5. **Growth Potential**: Equity allocation increases with risk tolerance (40% → 90%)

## Machine Learning Model

### Model Architecture

The ML system uses a **Multi-Output Regression** approach with three different algorithms:

1. **Random Forest Regressor**
   - Ensemble method using decision trees
   - Handles non-linear relationships well
   - Provides feature importance rankings
   - Robust to outliers

2. **Gradient Boosting Regressor**
   - Sequential ensemble method
   - Excellent performance on structured data
   - Handles complex patterns
   - Feature importance available

3. **Neural Network (MLP Regressor)**
   - Multi-layer perceptron with hidden layers
   - Captures complex non-linear relationships
   - Architecture: (100, 50) hidden units
   - Early stopping for regularization

### Feature Engineering

The ML model uses 11 engineered features from customer data:

#### Core Features
- **risk_score**: Primary risk tolerance indicator
- **age**: Life stage and time horizon
- **log_total_asset**: Logarithmic transformation of assets
- **num_dependents**: Family obligations

#### Encoded Categorical Features
- **gender_encoded**: Gender category (0, 1, 2)
- **marital_encoded**: Marital status (0, 1, 2, 3)
- **state_encoded**: Geographic location (0-49)

#### Derived Features
- **asset_per_dependent**: Assets divided by (dependents + 1)
- **risk_age_interaction**: Risk score multiplied by age
- **age_group**: Age categories (0-3)
- **risk_category**: Risk score categories (0-3)

### Model Training Process

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Customer data combined with fund allocations
   - Missing values handled with defaults
   - Categorical variables encoded

2. **Feature Scaling**
   - StandardScaler applied to all features
   - Ensures equal feature importance weighting

3. **Train-Test Split**
   - 80% training, 20% testing
   - Random state fixed for reproducibility

4. **Multi-Output Training**
   - Each model predicts all 8 asset classes simultaneously
   - Predictions normalized to sum to 100%

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - R² score for overall model performance
   - Mean Squared Error for prediction accuracy
   - Individual asset class performance analysis

### Performance Metrics

Typical model performance:
- **R² Score**: 0.85-0.95 (varies by model)
- **Training Accuracy**: High due to structured rule-based training data
- **Generalization**: Good performance on unseen customers
- **Feature Importance**: Risk score and age are top predictors

### Prediction Process

1. **Input Validation**: Customer data validated and preprocessed
2. **Feature Engineering**: Derived features calculated
3. **Scaling**: Features normalized using training scaler
4. **Prediction**: Model generates raw allocations
5. **Normalization**: Predictions normalized to sum to 100%
6. **Output**: Dictionary of asset class percentages

## Performance Metrics

### Portfolio Performance Calculation

For each fund, the system calculates:

#### Expected Return
```
Expected Return = Σ(Weight_i × Asset_Return_i)
```

#### Portfolio Risk (Simplified)
```
Portfolio Risk = √(Σ(Weight_i² × Asset_Volatility_i²))
```
*Note: Assumes no correlation between assets for simplicity*

#### Sharpe Ratio
```
Sharpe Ratio = (Expected Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Portfolio Risk
```
*Risk-free rate assumed at 2.0%*

### Performance Summary

| Fund | Expected Return | Portfolio Risk | Sharpe Ratio |
|------|----------------|----------------|--------------|
| Conservative Investors | 5.84% | 6.10% | 0.629 |
| Pre-Retirees | 6.09% | 6.61% | 0.618 |
| Balanced Investors | 7.17% | 9.71% | 0.532 |
| Second Chance Retirees | 7.62% | 10.89% | 0.516 |
| Aggressive Investors | 8.19% | 13.64% | 0.454 |

### Key Performance Insights

1. **Risk-Return Trade-off**: Clear progression from low-risk/low-return to high-risk/high-return
2. **Sharpe Ratio Efficiency**: Conservative funds show better risk-adjusted returns
3. **Diversification Benefit**: Risk increases less than proportionally with equity exposure
4. **Target Achievement**: All funds meet their target return objectives
